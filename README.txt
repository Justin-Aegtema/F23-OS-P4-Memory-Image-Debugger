FILE SYSTEM CHECKER
Compares inodes, bitmap, data blocks, files, and directories(folders) for internal consistency

INPUT:
prompt> fcheck test_case_name_here

prompt> fcheck file_system_image

Try any of the test cases! 
You can also compile xv6 and run the fs.img it creates. 
(I have xv6 in my F23 P2 Lotter Scheduler)
